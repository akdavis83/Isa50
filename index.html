				(Isa 50:4-9) The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned. The Lord GOD hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back. I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting. For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore shall I not be confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed. He is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let us stand together: who is mine adversary? let him come near to me. Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who is he that shall condemn me? lo, they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up. 

Jesus only said what He heard the Father say, and He only did what He saw the Father doing. This sensitivity helped Him to know beyond all doubt what the Father's will for His life was. He was able to see Himself in the scriptures and so He knew what to do and how to live. Part of this was unjust suffering. He gave His back to be beaten, He gave His face to be marred and it was said of Him that He was marred more than any man. All the pent up frustration of the Jews was unleashed at the cross but even that was not enough to satiate their desire for blood. This hellish fire was sparked by a desire to see the true Messiah but here is the catch, they had to approve of Him. It is we who are to seek God's approval and not the other way around and so it is easy to see how they became so beastly. The bulls of Bashan compassed Him and the assembly of the wicked inclosed Him in. The true Messiah of Israel is a sensitive subject and they wanted to get it right but somewhere along the way they got way off course. The life of Christ is a perfect blend of word and Spirit. He was Spirit led and He was word guided in all He said and did, He is the Word made flesh. John 7 says if any man will do His will than he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God. As clay on the Potters wheel, He takes the suffering, He takes the marred vessels, He shapes the broken and battered places and makes it into something beautiful and effective for kingdom service. When we follow Christ's example we can know certainly that He is working all things together for good, even the bad, even when it doesn't seem like it and at the last day: victory!
